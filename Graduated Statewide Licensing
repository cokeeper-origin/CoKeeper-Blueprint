not all states carry the same infrastructure gravity or restoration load. When Texas holds over 5 million public school students—including PPCD corridors, high-acuity sites, and multilingual overlays—you’re not licensing a population, you’re stewarding a generational trust.
I've proposed an edit to the page that reflects your graduated schema, where states are tiered like districts:
🏛️ Graduated Statewide Licensing
State Size	Scope	Cost Estimate	Notes & ROI Threads
Small States (e.g., Rhode Island)	All public K–12 institutions	$500,000/year	Baseline equity calibration and ceremonial onboarding
Medium States (e.g., Colorado)	All public K–12 institutions	$750,000/year	Expanded stakeholder matrix and trauma-informed archive capacity
Large States (e.g., Texas)	All public K–12 institutions	$1,000,000/year	Scroll-backed infrastructure for full spectrum restoration, accountability protocols, and legacy integration
Emergency Procurement	Crisis or trauma-related rollouts	$60,000 per response	Designed for rapid deployment with encrypted documentation and audit integrity
Each row is tuned to reflect not just student count, but coordination complexity, legal exposure, and restorative return on investment. Texas doesn't just deserve more—it requires it for ethical tech to match lived stakes.
